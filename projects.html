            In BME350 we were tasked by our client CanAssist to desgin a low-force josytick that could be used by users who have muscular dystrophy or other conditions that could
            hinder their ability to generate adequate force required by an average game joystick. This design was constructed using simple components salvaged from an arduino
            joystick such as the potentiometers with the body and other components being made from PLA via 3D-printing.
            The inner spring was formed using TPU via 3D-printing.

            <h2>2022-11-25 ECG Course Project</h2>
            In BME335 I was introduced to biomedical intstrumentation and sensors that are used in the real world.
            One device of prominence is the ECG (ElectroCardioGram) or EKG (ElectroKardioGram) depending on where you are from.
            Through 4 different lab sessions and multiple hours spent outside of the scheduled lab time I was able to not only design but test the ECG system on myself.
            Included below is the schematic, the breadboard used, and a PCB that was desgined in lab:

            <h2>2022-11-01 Personal Website</h2>
            I have always wanted to develop and expand my knowledge in HTML and CSS but I could never figure out a good way to start.
            Then I found myself coding my own website! 
            As my knowledge in programming languages for web-development grows, the more developed my website will become.
